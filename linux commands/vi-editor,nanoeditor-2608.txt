Modes in vim

Insert Mode: This is the mode where you can actually type text. You switch to Insert Mode from Normal Mode by pressing i, a, or o.
i: Inserts text before the cursor.
a: Inserts text after the cursor.
o: Opens a new line below the current line and inserts text there.
Command-Line Mode: You access this mode by pressing : in Normal Mode. In this mode, you can save your work, exit the editor, search for text, and execute other commands.

5. Tips for New Users
vi is case-sensitive, so make sure you use the correct case for commands.
Practice using the editor in a non-critical file until you’re comfortable with the commands.
Remember that vi is very keyboard-oriented, so using shortcuts and commands efficiently can greatly speed up your editing process.
vi might feel daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a very powerful tool for text editing.

Replace the first occurrence of a word in the entire file:
Use the command: :%s/old_word/new_word/
This will replace the first occurrence of old_word with new_word in each line of the file.
